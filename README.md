## The FGR file format

## Usage

## Contributing
This application is developed and maintained using Visual Studio, but contributors can obviously use whatever tools they want. It'll be easiest to work on, however, if you use Visual Studio.

At the moment, if you wish to work on Glimmer using Visual Studio, you'll have to update the include/library directories in the Visual Studio Project properties. In the future, when I figure out how to make project properties use relative include paths, this won't be neccessary. See the FREEGLUT readme for some additional information on that.
